# US — Decisions

Only durable decisions belong here. New missions should not reopen them without an explicit product decision.

## 2026-10-04

- Production frontend is **Cloudflare Pages**. Vercel is legacy/out of scope.
- `main` is production.
- US 2.0 backend foundation is complete; do not reopen broad backend-cleanup work without a concrete product need.
- Agent context belongs in repository docs, not repeated in large prompts.
- One meaningful mission uses one branch/worktree through audit, implementation, fixes and review.

### Gioca

- Gioca should become a strong return loop, not only a questionnaire catalog.
- Questionnaire/Game V2 content refreshes on a weekly rhythm.
- Planned questionnaire allowance: **5 sessions/week** instead of 3.
- “Crea domanda” stays, but its UX becomes: **write → seal → partner discovers it while playing**.
- Add a distinct **Arcade** area for non-verbal/touch minigames.
- First live arcade game: **Pulse**.
- Planned order: **Pulse → Stack Together → Relay → Duo Maze**.
- Live arcade uses the already-known partner: no room codes, usernames, public lobbies or matchmaking.
- First Pulse mission does **not** consume the Game V2 weekly questionnaire allowance.
- Build one reusable live-game invitation/lobby/reconnect/rematch foundation, then reuse it rather than rebuilding multiplayer per game.

### Product restraint

- Do not add new top-level navigation tabs for these features.
- Do not add fake currencies, energy systems or grind loops.
- Engagement should come from partner consequence, anticipation, live play and meaningful shared outcomes.

### Native iOS (M15)

- iOS is a Capacitor 8 target in `ios/` (Swift Package Manager) sharing the Android web bundle; bundle id `com.usapp.us`, deployment target **iOS 16.0**.
- Shared product JS stays platform-neutral; iOS specifics live in `ios/` and native-only glue in `native-entry.mjs` / `app-links.mjs`.
- iOS Back = left-edge swipe into `UsNavigation.handleNativeBack()`; never exits the app.
- Public URL scheme `com.usapp.us`; reserved App Group `group.com.usapp.us.shared` for all future extensions; refresh tokens never go in the App Group.
- WebView data (session) is excluded from iOS backups, mirroring Android `allowBackup=false`.
- The iOS WebView origin (`capacitor://localhost`) is frozen: changing it orphans stored sessions.
